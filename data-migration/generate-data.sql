-- TODO
-- Enrolment UUID
-- Some data is in non-event model. But the mapping would need to be done to event model.
-- To deal with we can capture the information in encounter also. In some cases we may have to create multiple encounters
-- on the same date, each capturing certain fields. For date of encounter we can pick some date in the entity model for
-- the encounter date, if possible. Discuss if a suitable date is found
